    <p>
      A new <strong>Chipotle Mexican Grill</strong> location is set to open along Route 30, adding another quick dining
      option for people where Denny's used to be located.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some are interested in the hiring opportunities that come with the new business opening in the area.

    <blockquote>
      “Route 30 already has a lot of food places, so having more choices just makes sense,” said one local shopper.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      While an exact opening date has not been confirmed, the restaurant is expected to open soon once inspections and
      final setup are complete. Until then, drivers can expect occasional parking lot changes and work crews near the
      site as the project wraps up.
    </p>

    <p><em>Tip:</em> Check the storefront signage and local listings for the official opening day.</p>
